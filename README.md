* PROBLEM ? --> Event organizers often struggle to keep track of how attendees feel during an event. They rely on post-event surveys or manually checking social media and feedback channels, which means they only learn about problems after the event is over. This leads to missed opportunities to fix issues in real time.


  Common event pain points include:
   1. Long queues at entry points and food stalls.
   2. Poor audio or visual quality during sessions.
   3. Overcrowding and safety concerns.
   4. Dissatisfaction with speakers or overall event management.


* OUR SOLUTION --> We're building an AI-driven sentiment monitoring platform that collects, analyzes, and alerts event organizers about attendee sentiment as it happens.
